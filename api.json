      "summary": "The Momo Challenge was an internet hoax and moral panic from 2018-2019 claiming a WhatsApp account with a disturbing profile image was encouraging children to perform dangerous tasks. Investigations by law enforcement and journalists found no evidence of actual participation or harm.",
      "full": "The Momo Challenge represents a case study in media-driven moral panic and viral misinformation. In 2018-2019, news outlets worldwide reported on an alleged 'suicide game' targeting children through WhatsApp and YouTube, featuring a disturbing image of a bulging-eyed woman-bird creature. The image was actually from 'Mother Bird,' a sculpture by Japanese artist Keisuke Aisawa. Despite extensive police investigations finding zero evidence of actual challenges, coordinated attacks, or related deaths, the story went viral through sensationalized media coverage. The phenomenon demonstrates how media amplification can create widespread fear over a non-existent threat, and serves as an important lesson in digital media literacy and responsible journalism."
